<h2 class="heading">Headings</h2>

<p>
With the heading classes the semantic meaning of the individual
h1-h6 can be separated from the styling applied via the classes.
This is by design so markup can remain semantic for accessibility
and generally good markup. Then the class can be applied to give
a specific style within context of the consuming application.

It's an excerpt from "A Farewell to Arms".

<h1 class="heading heading--large">A Farewell to Arms</h1>

<h2 class="heading heading">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>
    In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
    in a village that looked across the river and the plain to
    the mountains. In the bed of the river there were peb-
    bles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the
    water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the
    channels. Troops went by the house and down the road
    and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the
    trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the
    leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops march-
    ing along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred
    by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and
    afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.

    The plain was rich with crops; there were many
    orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the moun-
    tains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the
    mountains and at night we could see the flashes from
    the artillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning,
    but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling
    of a storm coming.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching
    under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-
    tractors. There was much traffic at night and many
    mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each
    side of their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that
    carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with
    canvas that moved slower in the traffic. There were big
    guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the
    long barrels of the guns covered with green branches
    and green leafy branches and vines laid over the trac-
    tors. To the north we could look across a valley and see
    a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another moun-
    tain on this side of the river. There was fighting for
    that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the
    fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the
    chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks
    black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-
    branched too and all the country wet and brown and
    dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river
    and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed
    mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet
    in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their
    capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of
    the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of
    clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward
    under the capes so that the men, passing on the road,
    marched as though they were six months gone with
    child.
</p>

<p>
    There were small gray motor-cars that passed going
    very fast ; usually there was an officer on the seat with
    the driver and more officers in the back seat. They
    splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of
    the officers in the back was very small and sitting be-
    tween two generals, he himself so small that you could
    not see his face but only the top of his cap and his nar-
    row back, and if the car went especially fast it was
    probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in
    this way nearly every day to see how things were going,
    and things went very badly.

    At the start of the winter came the permanent rain
    and with the rain came the cholera. But it was checked
    and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the
    army,

    The next year there were many victories. The
    mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside
    where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there
    were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the
    south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a
    house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick
    shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine
    purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting was
    in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away.
    The town was very nice and our house was very fine.
    The river ran behind us and the town had been cap-
    tured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it
    could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians
    seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if
    the war should end, because they did not bombard it to
    destroy it but only a little in a military way. People
    lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and
    artillery up side streets and two bawdy houses, one for
    troops and one for officers, and with the end of the
    summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains
    beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway
    bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fight-
    ing had been, the trees around the square and the long
    avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there
    being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor
    car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long
    necked body and gray beard like a goat's chin tuft ; all
    these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a
    wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their
    gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing
    ...
