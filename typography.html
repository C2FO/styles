        <p>
            Below you will see examples of various headings and the CSS needed
            to achieve each style. The size of the headings changes once you drop
            below the medium viewport width. This is on purpose to take up less
            space on smaller devices and make body text easier to read and
            standout more.

        <p>
            Here is an example of how text would look if done in large amounts. Below is an excerpt
            from a "Farewell to Arms" by Earnest Hemingway.

            <h1 class="heading heading--large">A Farewell to Arms</h1>

            <h2 class="heading heading">Chapter 1</h2>

            <p>
                In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
                in a village that looked across the river and the plain to
                the mountains. In the bed of the river there were peb-
                bles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the
                water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the
                channels. Troops went by the house and down the road
                and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the
                trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the
                leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops march-
                ing along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred
                by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and
                afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading heading--small">This is fake heading</h3>
            <p>
                The plain was rich with crops; there were many
                orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the moun-
                tains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the
                mountains and at night we could see the flashes from
                the artillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning,
                but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling
                of a storm coming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching
                under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-
                tractors. There was much traffic at night and many
                mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each
                side of their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that
                carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with
                canvas that moved slower in the traffic. There were big
                guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the
                long barrels of the guns covered with green branches
                and green leafy branches and vines laid over the trac-
                tors. To the north we could look across a valley and see
                a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another moun-
                tain on this side of the river. There was fighting for
                that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the
                fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the
                chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks
                black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-
                branched too and all the country wet and brown and
                dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river
                and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed
                mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet
                in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their
                capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of
                the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of
                clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward
                under the capes so that the men, passing on the road,
                marched as though they were six months gone with
                child.
            </p>

            <p>
                There were small gray motor-cars that passed going
                very fast ; usually there was an officer on the seat with
                the driver and more officers in the back seat. They
                splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of
                the officers in the back was very small and sitting be-
                tween two generals, he himself so small that you could
                not see his face but only the top of his cap and his nar-
                row back, and if the car went especially fast it was
                probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in
                this way nearly every day to see how things were going,
                and things went very badly.

                At the start of the winter came the permanent rain
                and with the rain came the cholera. But it was checked
                and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the
                army,
            </p>

            <p>
                The next year there were many victories. The
                mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside
                where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there
                were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the
                south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a
                house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick
                shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine
                purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting was
                in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away.
                The town was very nice and our house was very fine.
                The river ran behind us and the town had been cap-
                tured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it
                could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians
                seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if
                the war should end, because they did not bombard it to
                destroy it but only a little in a military way. People
                lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and
                artillery up side streets and two bawdy houses, one for
                troops and one for officers, and with the end of the
                summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains
                beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway
                bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fight-
                ing had been, the trees around the square and the long
                avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there
                being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor
                car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long
                necked body and gray beard like a goat's chin tuft ; all
                these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a
                wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their
                gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing
                ...

                applied. It is expected to add a modifier class to support
