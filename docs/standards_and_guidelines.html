    <h1 class="heading">Coding Standards and Guidelines</h1>

    <p>
    As applications evolve over time they will look different and likely
    preform different functions. However, at the core their code should not
    evolve too much. By following a set of standards and code guidelines
    a code base will have longevity and maintainability.

    Below you'll see guidelines on how to contribute to this project. These
    guidelines are also recommended for any application. Primarily the
    suggestions you see here are an accumulation of existing standards and
    best practices for creating great applications.
    </p>


    <article>
        <h1 class="heading heading--small">Philosophy</h1>

        <p>
        Before getting into the lower level coding recommendations we'll define
        what this project expects for <em>all</em> of its code. Composition is king.
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Containers do not assume content</li>
            <li>CSS for looks is separate from CSS for layout</li>
            <li>CSS should be semantic</li>
            <li>Avoid utility classes in markup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">Containers and Content</h2>

        <p>
        By building containers that <em>do not</em> assume their contents it allows for
        greater flexibility. For instance, a column grid
        component usually pads in the inner content. Depending on the usage of
        the grid this "gutter" may not be desired. To overcome this developers
        usually have to add negative margin to their inner children to overcome
        the assumptions made by a container.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another reason for containers to not assume content is around composition.
        It is much easier to build up quality user interactions when the components
        are easily mixed together. As soon as containers assume what is inside, the
        ability to easily compose components into larger components goes away.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">Separate Layout and Looks</h2>

        <p>
        CSS is used for both layout and looks via styles. However, when building reusable
        and scalable CSS it is best to separate classes that are the core layout
        of a component and the classes that give looks to the component.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example a <code>button</code> class should give the structure of a
        button. In order to enhance the button to look a certain way a class
        for looks should be added, for example <code>button--primary</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        These recommendations relate back to composition. By having a clean
        separation it is easy to compose different variations of a core
        component without having to rely on a lot of complex overrides.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">Semantics</h2>

        <p>
        CSS must be semantic. This leads to easier to maintain code
        and code that can grow. A good example here relates to colors and
        alerts. It would be a bad idea to create a class <code>color-red</code>.
        A much better choice is <code>color-alert--critical</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Semantics allow for the lower level color to change and keep the meaning
        in the code.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">Utility Classes</h2>

        <p>
        Avoid creating and using utility classes. At first glance it may seem
        okay to add a "remove all margin" class or a "no left padding" class.
        However, these types of classes usually highlight a flaw in the existing
        components. The question to ask is "why do I need this one-off change?"
        </p>

        <p>
        There will be cases that a utility class is needed, however, these classes
        should be mixed into a more semantic class. For example, if an article on
        a page needs to remove the left padding give that a better name for the
        specific type of article that needs to remove that padding. Maybe the
        article is picture heavy, give it class name of <code>article--picture-heavy</code>.
        </p>

    <article>
        <h1 class="heading heading--small">CSS Details</h1>

        <p>
        At low level it is good to have constraints in
        place. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">Constraint theory</a>
        tells us that having some level of control in a system helps increase
        the throughput and maintainability of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
        At a high level here is how to write the CSS.
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/">CSSGuidelines</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM</a></li>
            <li>Avoid styling HTML elements directly</li>
            <li>Limit selector specificity</li>
            <li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Units"><code>rem</code></a> units</li>
            <li>Favor using extends over mixins to reduce CSS rules</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">Writing Code: BEM and CSSGuidelines</h2>

        <p>
        The code should follow the ideals described
        in the <a href="http://cssguidelin.es/">http://cssguidelin.es/</a>. Some specifics to call out:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/#low-level">Reverse footnote commenting</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/#titling">Tilting</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/#meaningful-whitespace">Meaningful whitespace</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/#css-selectors">CSS selectors</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://cssguidelin.es/#the-single-responsibility-principle">Single responsibility principle</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM naming</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        There are two rules that we do not follow. Do not add extra space for BEM elements
        and modifiers. Favor using extends in LESS over having a lot of CSS rules that
        get complied out.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading heading--extra-small">rem Units</h2>

        <p>
        When building out components most measurements should favor using <code>rem</code> units.
        The exceptions to this rule are parts that <em>should not</em> scale. For example a border width
        should not grow or shrink based on screen resolution.
        </p>

        <p>
        <code>rem</code> units are used because it provides a consistent and constant way to
        apply measurements to components. The largest reason to use <code>rem</code> units
        is to keep the proportions between typography and components inline. Measurements
        should be based in typography. Since typographical elements are the base
        of design they should be used to build out the rest of the application.
        </p>

        <h1 class="heading heading--small">Components</h1>

        <p>
        Components are the smallest unit developed and consumed by this ui guide.
        Rules for developing components:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li><em>Only</em> apply margin and padding to components</li>
            <li>Margin and padding is built off of <code>rem</code> units</li>
            <li>Must support RTL and LTR</li>
            <li>Only have 4 sizes: large, default, small, and extra-small (all 4 not required)</li>
            <li>Must be documented for consumption</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="heading">Code Location</h1>

        <p>
            For the most part file names are fairly self explanatory on what lives with them.
            For example, the file called
            <code>buttons.less</code> holds the code for the
            button components. For more reused parts here are some files and what can
            be found within them:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><code>colors.less</code></dt>
            <dd>The base colors for the site. See individual file for further explanation</dd>
            <dt><code>measurements.less</code></dt>
            <dd>Base values for widths and heights (e.g. margin, padding, borders).</dd>
            <dt><code>mouse.less</code></dt>
            <dd>Contains values for the mouse on screen.</dd>
            <dt><code>typography.less</code></dt>
            <dd>Contains basic site wide settings for text display</dd>
        </dl>

        <h1 class="heading">Adding Docs</h1>

        <p>
            To make adding documentation easier it is recommended to use this tool to create the escaped HTML.
            <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html#ad-output">http://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html#ad-output</a>
            Once you have that tool write your HTML as you would normally and then copy paste it into the tool.
            Use the output inside code blocks to show what you've done. A recommendation for making that easy
            is to use column selection in your editor. See the button documentation for examples.
