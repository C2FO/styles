    Global styles for application.

    The styles found within this file should apply to every site that
    consumes this guide. These styles should be fairly straight forward
    and deal with the basics of a web site. Anything more specific should
    live within its own file.

    1. Heading    ... Contains styles for all headings (used in typography)
    2. Typography ... Contains styles for typography (e.g. font sizes)

    Technical notes:

    * `rem` - in general `rem` units are used to keep spacing or size aligned
              for for the _entire_ site. This means that the spacing is only
              based on the `html` styles and nothing else, where as the `em`
              would get smaller and/or bigger relative to its parent
              container.
    * BEM   - The CSS found in this project uses the BEM methodology. This
              leads to more modular and scalable CSS. When using this
              project it may seem like a lot of extra CSS classes are
              needed. This is by design and makes it obvious what something
              is suppose to look like.
              (e.g. <h2 class="heading heading--extra-large">Heading</h2>)

    #Heading

    Typographical styles for all headings. Later in the Typography section
    specific versions of these headers will be "mixed" into the media
    queries.

    Possible headings:

    .heading--large       ... large heading
    .heading              ... basic heading (should be used for most cases)
    .heading--small       ... small heading (most useful for sub-headings)
    .heading--extra-small ... smallest heading (use sparingly)

    Note: Values for `font-size` and `line-height` are gathered from the link
    below with sensible rounded out values.

\* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
.heading {
    font-size: bold;
    font-size: 1.9rem;
    line-height: 2.4rem;
}

.heading--large {
    font-size: 2.4rem;
    line-height: 3rem;
}

.heading--small {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    line-height: 1.9rem;
}

.heading--extra-small {
    font-size: 1.25rem;
    line-height: 1.7rem;
}

    #Typography

    These styles assume that the Google font 'Open Sans' is being used.
    The line heights and font sizes are based heavily on the following
    articles:

    1. This is the base font size. All other font sizes will be relative to
        this size. This allows for better scaling and easier to read pages.
    2. Line height is computed form the font-size to make text easier to read.
        in general this value will very depending on the text to read. For
        example headings will have a smaller line height because they have
        larger font-size. While paragraphs and flow text will have larger
        line-height because they have smaller text.
        Note: `rem` is used to keep _all_ line-height consistent across the
            site.
    3. Prevent iOS and IE text size adjust after device orientation change,
        without disabling user zoom. See normalize.css
    4. In order to avoid overflowing containers _all_ text should break
        if it must to stay within its container.
    5. Whenever the site is viewed on anything smaller than a medium sized
        screen we should increase the base font size and decrease the
        header sizes. This allows for a better viewing and reading
        experience for users.  This uses the bootstrap defined md-min of 992px:
        https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.3.2/less/variables.less#L294,
        decoupled to avoid direct dependence on bootstrap.
